    <h1>Hello lovely world!!!!</h1>
        <p>This is my first paragraph. I am restarting my journey with coding as I took some time off. I am enjoying the learning process and am excited to continue on.</p>
        <p>While I go through the lessons I am reminded of a lot of basics. This is my chance to test my knowledge as I am writing out the <em>HTML boilerplate</em> from memory and practicing adding <strong>elements</strong>.</p>
